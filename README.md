# AI-2-Univ-AI

This repository consists of all the assignments, projects, and lab sessions which I worked in the course AI-2 Computer Vision, offered by Prof. Pavlos Protopapas, Univ.AI. In the final project we worked on the problem, "Computer Vision for hurricane disaster management". Some of the notable lab sessions include autoencoders, transfer learning, effect of several optimizers on training etc.
